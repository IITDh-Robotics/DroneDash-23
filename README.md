# Drone Dash 2023
This repository contains the support guide for Drone Dash @ Summer of Innovation 2023, IIT Dharwad.

# Introduction
## Objective
The objective in Drone Dash is to design a obstacle avoidance algoritm for a drone.

## Development Environment
You will be developing the algorithm for use with the [PX4 Autopilot Stack](https://px4.io/) in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). The PX4 Autopilot is a flight control software stack for drones. ROS is a robotics middleware that provides a set of tools and libraries for developing robot applications.

You will be using the [Gazebo](https://classic.gazebosim.org/) simulator to test your algorithm. Gazebo is a 3D robotics simulator that provides a physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces.

Instructions for setting up the development environment are provided in the [Installation Guide](./docs/Installation.md).
